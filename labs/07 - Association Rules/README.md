# ASSOCIATION RULES

This week, we explore association rule mining using the `mlxtend` library. This technique helps uncover patterns in transactional data, such as products often bought together. You'll learn to compute and use key metrics: support, confidence, and lift, and how to extract and filter meaningful rules.

After the [walkthrough](https://www.google.com/), complete the [exercises](https://www.google.com/) and the [quiz](https://www.google.com/) for this lab.
